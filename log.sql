--One of the coolest exercises in Harvard's CS50 course!

--There has been a robbery in the city of Fiftyville and the mission is to solve the mystery by consulting information in an SQLite database. All that is known is that the robbery occurred on July 28, 2020 on Chamberlin Street. Authorities believe that shortly after the robbery, the thief flew out of town with the help of an accomplice.

--The objective is to identify: who the thief is, which city he fled to and who the accomplice who helped him escape.

--The DB contains data tables about the city such as security records, phone calls, bank transactions, license plates and airport flight information.

-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse. Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

SELECT name, transcript FROM interviews WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND year = 2020 AND transcript LIKE "%thief%";
--Ruth: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                      |
--Eugene: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                      |
--Raymond: As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
